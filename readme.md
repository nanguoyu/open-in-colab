# 📘 Open in Colab

[中文](./readme_cn.md)

This Tampermonkey script adds a convenient floating button to GitHub pages hosting Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files). Clicking the button allows users to open the notebook directly in Google Colab with ease.

## ✨ Features

- 🚀 **Easy to Use:** A floating "Open in Colab" button is automatically added to GitHub pages with Jupyter Notebooks.
- 🔄 **Dynamic Visibility:** The button only appears on pages containing `.ipynb` files and remains hidden on other pages.

## 🛠 Installation

1. Ensure [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) is installed in your browser.
2. Click to [Install from GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nanguoyu/open-in-colab/main/open-in-colab.user.js).

## 📖 Usage

After installation, navigate to any Jupyter Notebook file on GitHub (URLs ending with `.ipynb`). A floating "Open in Colab" button will appear at the bottom right of the page. Click it, and the notebook will open in a new tab in Google Colab.

You can try [example.ipynb](./example.ipynb)!
